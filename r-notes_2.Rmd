# Hands on with Dplyr:
http://www.r-bloggers.com/dplyr-tutorial-verbs-split-apply/

```{r}
data(mtcars)
data = mtcars

data$cyl = factor(data$cyl)
```


Before we had the split-apply-combine pattern. Now we can do something liek this.


```{r}
library(dplyr)
vars = c("mpg","wt","qsec")
data %>% group_by(cyl) %>% select(one_of(vars)) %>% summarise_each(funs(median(.)))

```

So it is essentially the piping operation:
