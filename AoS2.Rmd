Random variables link sample spaces and probability to data. 

A random variable maps a Real number $X(\omega)$ to each outcome, $\omega$. The sample space rarely gets mentioned in practice and we usually work directly with Random variables but the sample space is alwas there.

Example: Let $X(\omega)$ be the number of heads in the sequence $\omega$. If $\omega = HHTHHTHHTT$ then $X(\omega) = 6$

The inverse CDF is also known as the Quantile function. 

"Here is an example which I borrowed" is great wording
