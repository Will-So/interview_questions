Sample space | Set of possible outcomes of an experiment
Event | subset of sample space

The event space of a physical quantity can be $\Omega = (-\inf, \inf)$. We can have events in ranges (e.g., between 10 and 23. ). Sets are monotonically increasing if $A_1 \subset A_2 \subset A_3$

Disjoint properties are important because they occur in cases of flipping coins -- either the result is heads or tails. It can;t be both.

If the event space is finite and each outcome is equally likely, we have that
